# zkBitcoin Miner Overview

zkBitcoin Miner forked from IwYeo's SoliditySHA3Miner

Designed for developers and enthusiasts looking to mine zkBitcoin, a minable ERC-918 compatible token on zkSync Era.

## System Requirements and Dependencies

The zkBitcoin Miner is built with the following technologies and libraries:

- **.NET 5.0**: Necessary for running the miner. Download from [Microsoft .NET Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-5.0.5-windows-x64-installer).
- **VC++ 2019**: Required for certain cryptographic functions. Download from [Visual Studio](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) or [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).
- **nVidia CUDA SDK 10.2** (64-bit): For nVidia GPU support. Ensure your nVidia drivers are version 396 or above. [nVidia Drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/drivers/beta).
- **AMD APP SDK v3.0.130.135** (OpenCL): For AMD GPU support. Download from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P5jqRGbWRW1l5vxlm8MqaQRBKpUNUSyf/view?usp=sharing).
- **gcc 4.8.5**: For compiling on Linux-based systems.

## Getting Started with Solo Mining

### Prerequisites

Before starting with zkBitcoin mining, ensure you have the following:

- **.NET Core Runtime**: For Windows, download from [Microsoft .NET Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-5.0.5-windows-x64-installer). For Ubuntu, use the `sudo ./install-deps.sh` script. For Ethos, use `sudo ./install-deps-ethOS.sh`.
- **Nvidia or AMD GPU Drivers**: Ensure you have the latest drivers installed that support CUDA or OpenCL, respectively.

### Configuration

1. Open the `_zkBitcoinMiner.conf` file for editing.
2. Update the following configuration parameters as needed:
   - `minerAddress`: Your zkSync Era (Ethereum) address for mining rewards (must include the '0x' prefix).
   - `privateKey`: Your private key associated with the mining zkSync Era (Ethereum) address.
   - `MinZKBTCperMint` and `MaxZKBTCperMint`: Set your desired minimum and maximum zkBitcoin rewards per mint transaction. (Note, if omitted, this will default to `250` and `500` zkBitcoin respectively)
   - `HowManyBlocksAWAYFromAdjustmentToSendMinimumZKBTC`: Adjust this value based on how many blocks away from the adjustment you wish to start sending the minimum zkBitcoin. This can be a value from 0 - 2000 depending on how many other users are submitting. (Note, if omitted, this will default to `200` blocks)
   - `web3api`: Replace with your own web3api if needed; defaults to the provided Alchemy account for testing.

3. Save your changes to `_zkBitcoinMiner.conf`.

### Starting the Miner

To begin mining:
1. Run the `_zkBitcoin Miner Start.bat` file in the miner's directory.
2. Ensure you have a minimal amount of ZK Sync Era Ethereum in your account to start.

## Usage and Options

The miner supports various command-line options for customization, including but not limited to enabling CPU mining, setting GPU intensity, specifying mining pools, and adjusting gas prices for transactions.

## Notes

- Refer to 'GuideForSoloMining.txt' on how to get started.
- Configuration is based on CLI (similar to ccminer), except ".abi" files are required for new tokens (You can manually create one and copy from etherscan.com -> Contract -> Code -> Contract ABI).
- Sample CLI launch parameter can be found in the ".bat" file found together with this miner, please refer to it if you need help.
- Ensure you are mining to the correct address/account. This is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.
- It is recommended to use your own web3api (e.g. Infura / Geth / Parity) if you solo mine, default value is for TESTING PURPOSES ONLY.
- A default developer fee of 2.0% is applied.
- In the case if the compute load for your GPU is not >= 99%, you can adjust the intensity via (amdIntensity/cudaIntensity/intelIntensity).

Thank you for trying out the zkBitcoin Miner!
